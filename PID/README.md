#PID Control and Vehicle Kinematic Simulation  
Here's what have been done in this project:  
-Standard PID controller  
-PID twiddler(coefficient self optimization)  
-One dimensional Car simulation(speed,distance,acceleration,friction,wind resistance,etc)  
-Two dimensional Vehicle simulation(vehicle kinematic,dynamic model,etc)  
  
Here are some test results:

##2D Vehicle Simulation  
A vehicle steering at a fixed angle and fixed speed,whose trajectory is exactly a circle.
